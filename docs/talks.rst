Talk Types
==========

Before opening up talk submissions, define the talk types available to
talk submitters, such as Tutorial, Short Talks and so forth.

Submitting Talks
================

Users can submit talks from their profile page using the ``Submit Talk Proposal``
option. The abstract can be formatted using Markdown

The notes section is only visible to the talk author, talk mentors and 
admins. It is intended for providing extra information and recording
developments that are useful to associate with the talk, but should
not be public.

Talks can have multiple authors, but only one corresponding author. Only
the corresponding author can edit the talk submission.

Talk Mentors
============

The ``Talk Mentors`` group has permission to view all talk submissions and
to edit talks. They also have permission to view the notes submitted along
with a talk.

Managing talks from the admin interface
=======================================

From the admin interface talks can be modified, and marked as accepted,
cancelled or not accepted as required.


Talk urls
=========

Urls can be associated with talks using the admin interface. This is
intended for adding links to slides and videos of the talk after the
conference.
