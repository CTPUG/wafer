A wafer-thin web application for running small conferences. Built using Django.

Licensed under the `ISC License`_.

.. _ISC License: https://github.com/CTPUG/wafer/blob/master/LICENSE


Documentation
=============

Available on `readthedocs.org`_.

.. _readthedocs.org: http://wafer.readthedocs.org/

Supported Django versions
=========================

Wafer supports Django 1.8 and Django 1.9.


Installation
============

1. ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` should install all the required
   python and django dependencies.

2. Wafer uses npm to manage front-end dependencies

   * Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed that
     includes ``npm``.

   * Run ``npm install`` to install all dependencies, which also copies
     them to ``wafer/static/vendor``.

3. Install the wafer applications
   ``manage.py migrate``

4. If you don't have one yet, create a superuser with
   ``manage.py createsuperuser``.

5. Examine the ``settings.py`` file and create a
   ``localsettings.py`` file overriding the defaults
   as required.

   ``STATIC_FILES``, ``WAFER_MENUS``, ``MARKITUP_FILTER``,
   ``WAFER_TALKS_OPEN``, ``WAFER_REGISTRATION_OPEN`` and
   ``WAFER_PUBLIC_ATTENDEE_LIST`` will probably need to be
   overridden.

   If you add extensions to ``MARKITUP_FILTER``, be
   sure to install the appropriate python packages as well.

6. Log in and configure the Site:

   * The domain will be used as the base for e-mails sent during
     registration.

   * The name will be the conference's name.

7. Wafer uses the Django caching infrastructure in several places, so
   the cache table needs to be created using ``manage.py createcachetable``.

8. Create the default 'Page Editors' and 'Talk Mentors' groups using
   ``manage.py wafer_add_default_groups``.

9. Have a fun conference.

Installing Bootstrap
====================

The default templates and css files require jquery and bootstrap to work.

wafer provides a bower.json file to simplify the installation process. This
requires a working nodejs installation.

1. Install bower
   ``npm install bower``

2. Use bower to install appropriate versions of bootstrap and jquery
   ``$(npm bin)/bower install``

3. Move files to the correct location
   ``manage.py collectstatic``
